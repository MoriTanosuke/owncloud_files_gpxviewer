GPX Viewer plugin for Owncloud 5.x
==================================

This plugin enables [owncloud][1] to show GPX files directly in the browser, using [LeafletJS][0] and [GPX plugin by Maxime Petazzoni][2].

Open issues
===========

* The mimetype for the GPX files is set to *text/gpx* and *application/gpx+xml*, but my owncloud installation is returning GPX files as *text/plain*. Currently I don't know how to fix this, but maybe your server setup is more sensible.
